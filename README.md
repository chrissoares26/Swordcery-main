you just lost the game.

## Getting Started
To run the game, make sure that you have the latest arcade version installed, and you should be good to go! When ready to play, simply run main.py and have fun!
You get points every time you beat a level and for each enemy you kill and coin you collect, but watch out! It only gets added to your score if you successfully beat the level, and dying will deduct from your total score. Want to get an even higher score? Keep playing once you've reached the end and see how high it can go!
